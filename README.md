# What is Cartridge?
test change

A [Cartridge](http://accenture.github.io/adop-docker-compose/docs/operating/cartridges/) is a set of resources that are loaded into the Platform for a particular [ADOP](http://accenture.github.io/adop-docker-compose/) 	 project. They may contain anything from a simple reference implementation for a technology to a set of best practice examples for building, deploying, and managing a technology stack that can be used by a project.

This cartridge makes it easy to play with Ansible.  See [this blog](https://markosrendell.wordpress.com/?p=553&preview=true) for more information.
